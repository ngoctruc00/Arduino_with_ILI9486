# MAKE INTERFACCE HUMAN WITH ARDUINO MEGA & ILI9486 MODULE



#1. Import Lib From "Thu-Vien-Can-Dung" on your Arduino IDE
 - Download all Lib.zip in this Folder
 - Open Arduino IDE. Choose Sketch > Include Libary > ADD .ZIP Libary and select all Lib.zip above.
 
#2. Connect hardware Arduino Mega and ILI9486 Module 
 
I bought all elements on HCM City - VietNam and it's so easy to connect together.
 - Buy ILI9846 at Link: https://hshop.vn/products/man-hinh-cam-ung-arduino-tft-shield-3-5-inch-ili9486
 - Buy Mega at Link:https://hshop.vn/products/arduino-mega-2560r3
 - Buy DS18B20 at Link: https://hshop.vn/products/cam-bien-nhiet-do-ds18b20-day
 
#3. Code test 
 - Touch on ILI9846 with Arduino Mega at " \Code-Test\draw\draw.ino "
 - Test Sensor at "\Code-Test\readanalog-sensor\readanalog-sensor.ino"

#4. Main of this Project is in "He-Thong-Lanh-Trung-Tam/He-Thong-Lanh-Trung-Tam.ino"
 - Attension:   _Check PIN in-out on Mega kit_
                _On Srceen, you can see realtime value from temp-sensor and set your value on system_
